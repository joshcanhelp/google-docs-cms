# Google Docs CMS

Described fully [here](http://www.joshcanhelp.com/google-docs-cms/). 

**Note**: Unfortunately, it looks like the ability to publish sheets as RSS has been removed. The site above runs on this script so sheets that are already able to publish have been grandfathered. I tried around 3/1/2015 to create a new sheet with this capapbility and was not able to do so.
